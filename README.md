I'm **Gabriel, a CS student** in Los Angeles. Currently, I'm studying machine learning, biomedical engineering and software engineering.

I am primarily a Swift Developer, focusing on arm64 platforms on Darwin. I've also dabbled in Rust, Crystal, JS, and Python~
<br>I love learning languages, both programming and natural, so I'd love any tips/lessons on languages you're passionate about!

Currently figuring out some App Store apps and ASWF Swift Workgroup!
